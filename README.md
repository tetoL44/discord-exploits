<b>DO NOT DM ME ASKING WHY THE WINDOW CLOSES INSTANTLY WHEN YOU DOUBLE CLICK IT, 

DISCORD-EXPLOITS IS A COMMAND-LINE UTILITY MEANING YOU HAVE TO USE IT FROM A TERMINAL

IF THE PROGRAM SHOWS AN ERROR, READ THE ERROR BEFORE MESSAGING ME</b>



### Getting Help

`discord-exploits -h` will show you what commands can be used and what you have to do

### Creating an Expanding Video file

`discord-exploits -m <mode> -i <input file> [-q]` 

the mode `c` stands for "crash", this file will crash almost any desktop discord client when it is played to the end

the mode `v` stands for virus image

the mode `e` stands for expanding video duration

the mode `n` stands for negative video duration

the mode `0` or `z` stands for video with 0s duration

the mode `t` stands for "twice", this file will play a different audio when it is replayed (still experimental)

The Program only supports `webm` files for video, `png` files for images and `ogg` files for audio (t)

##### The file will be saved with a random file name in the directory in which you ran the command
##### You can use [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) to convert a video to .webm or to convert an image to png (better than online converters)
##### The "virus" image may get flagged by windows defender and will get removed. to restore the file, go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Virus & Threat protection and restore the file

## Features
### Current Features
* Feature for creating a video that, when played on discord, will seem like infinite, because the duration keeps getting longer
* Feature for creating a video that, when played on discord, will look like it has got a huge negative duration
* Feature for creating a video that, when played on discord, will look like it has got a constant duration of 0
* Feature for creating an image then triggers other users' windows defender after being cached
* Feature for creating an audio file that plays a different track when you replay it ([always requires FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org))
* Feature for creating a video that, when played on a discord client, will crash it ([always requires FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org))
* Transcoding from `mp4` to `webm`, from `jpeg` and `jpg` to `png` and from `mp4` and `m4a` to `ogg` ([requires FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org))

### Disclaimer
The t/twice mode requires ffmpeg with all compatible file formats, even `ogg`, because the current version of the exploit has to convert the audio to a sample rate of 44100.

The c/crash mode also requires ffmpeg will all compatible file formats, because the input file needs to be concatenated with another file.

### Upcoming Features are:
not yet decided.
